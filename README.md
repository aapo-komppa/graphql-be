# the other app
Basic BE nest.js/mongodb/graphql app. Usage through graphql playground. http://localhost:3001/graphql

## setting up the app
- have docker installed and running
- run `sh up.sh`

## known issues:
- up.sh seems to sometimes create mongo-init.js folder instead of file
- - if this happens, just delete the folder and volume and retry
